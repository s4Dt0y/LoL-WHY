# **LoL-WHY (Luck of the Leprechaun Who Hates You)**
LoL-WHY is a simple, no-skill-involved
game written in Rust where you try to
cut the right wire. Each time you defuse the bomb you get
number of points. However, your chances go from
1/2 to 1/100000. If you can win, you should be famous.
You probably won't be, but you'll 
be famous in my eyes, at least. 

# Instructions

Run the program, and choose a number in the given range.
Press enter, and see if you defused the bomb. Most likely,
you didn't.

*If I have the time, I might implement a cheat script in
Python. If I take too long, do it yourself.*
